 Explain how git enables saving codee# Quiz

Answer the following questions. Add each answer in a separate commit. (E.g. fill in the answer for question 1. commit your changes. add the answer for question 2. commit your changes. add the answer for question 3. commit your changes)

1. Explain how git enables saving code.

Git allows users to save code by providing a codebase, or repository, for code at any period in development. The working code directory can then be used to experiment and make changes which may or may not be committed to the repository.
ource code management (SCM) is used to track modifications to a source code repository. SCM tracks a running history of changes to a code base and helps resolve conflicts when merging updates from multiple contributors. SCM is also synonymous with Version control.

2. Explain how git enables tracking code.
 You are probably already doing some type of version control, if you save multiple files, such as Dissertation_script_25thFeb.R, Dissertation_script_26thFeb.R, etc. This approach will leave you with tens or hundreds of similar files, making it rather cumbersome to directly compare different versions, and is not easy to share among collaborators. With version control software such as Git, version control is much smoother and easier to implement
Git enables tracking code by saving snapshots of a repository's state throughout development. This way, the code and file's individual changes can be tracked. Timestamps and user ID's are attached to every commit allowing not only the state of the code to be tracked, but also who is changing it.

3. Explain how git enables sharing code.

Git enables sharing code by allowing users to clone and fork repositories so that they can make changes to their own version of the code. The changes can be reconciled when users push their commits to the branch or merge their respective branches. Commit messages, user ID's and timestamps allow users to see where why and how they are changing the code.
